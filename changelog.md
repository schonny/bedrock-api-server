## New:
- Quickstart-mode: If you don't want to operate your bedrock server using the API or CLI, you can simply start your server in quickstart mode. To do this, you just need to provide a name for the server and/or the world, and it will be immediately created or started, depending on whether the server already exists or not.

## Fixed:
- function update-server()
